        <h2>Looking Back: I Have Changed</h2><br><hr>
        <p class="date">12 January 2025 - Experience</p>

        <p>
            Looking back, it is incredible how much I have changed over the past few years. If I had known how quickly the world moves, I would have probably told people to slow down and take things easy. That does not mean I have accomplished everything in life or that I am now ready to leave this world. Some people might take it that way because they tend to see things from a narrow perspective. But my point is simple: I have undergone a significant transformation, and I am embracing it. I often wonder if this is something that happens to everyone or just me, but when the realization hits, it feels deep. It is a remarkable experience to find myself in a place where I once felt afraid to go. I believe this is a normal part of human growth, and I am genuinely happy to be experiencing it.
       </p>
       <p>Saying, "I have changed," feels almost surreal. It might even sound exciting to some—perhaps making them curious about the extent of my transformation. But let me clarify: I have not changed in the way most people might think. Of course, my physical appearance might have changed due to natural aging or seasonal effects, but the essence of who I am remains the same. If a friend who last saw me three years ago met me today, they would still recognize me without any difficulty. So, in that sense, I have not changed. However, my thoughts and perspectives have evolved. That is the real transformation.</p>
       <p>It is not surprising that we do not remain the same person we were in childhood. We grow, we learn, and our minds expand. But personally experiencing this shift—becoming aware of my own changes—feels different. It is like breathing in a new kind of air. The realization hits me deeply every time I reflect on how much I have grown. I have gained confidence in speaking to people, I have learned how to handle difficult situations, and I have developed a level of maturity that allows me to express myself more clearly. These changes have helped me navigate life better and with greater ease.</p>
       <p>One of the biggest lessons I have learned is that not everyone is as happy as they seem. It is important not to compare ourselves to others. When we see people smiling and appearing content, we only witness their outward expressions. There is a high chance—maybe 98%—that they are also looking at us and thinking that we are happier than they are. The truth is, everyone has their own struggles and battles, most of which remain unseen. This realization has helped me focus on my own journey instead of constantly measuring my happiness against others'.</p>
    <p>I often feel like I have grown so much in just a single day. When I reflect on who I was yesterday, I sometimes cringe at my own actions. I ask myself, "Why did I do that? What was I thinking?" If the person I am today were present yesterday, I would have acted differently. But perhaps that is the beauty of growth. The present version of ourselves constantly teaches the past version what could have been done better. That is how we improve.</p>
    <p>For example, I remember situations where I hesitated to speak up in public. A few years ago, I lacked the confidence to express my opinions. I feared judgment, and I worried about saying the wrong things. But over time, I found myself in situations where staying silent was not an option. Slowly, I built the courage to voice my thoughts. The first time I spoke in front of a crowd, my hands were shaking, and my voice was unsteady. But I pushed through. With each new experience, I grew more confident. Now, I can stand in front of people and express myself without hesitation. This shift in mindset and confidence is one of the most valuable changes I have experienced.</p>
    <p>Similarly, I have learned how to deal with problems more effectively. There was a time when even the smallest challenges felt overwhelming. I used to overthink situations and stress about things beyond my control. But through experience, I realized that problems are a part of life, and stressing over them does not make them disappear. Instead of panicking, I started approaching challenges with a problem-solving mindset. This change has made life much easier for me.</p>
       <p>I have also noticed how my emotional maturity has developed. Earlier, I would get upset over small things, whether it was a disagreement with a friend or a minor setback. But now, I understand that not everything deserves an emotional reaction. I have learned to pick my battles wisely. Some things are simply not worth the stress. Instead of reacting impulsively, I take a step back, analyze the situation, and respond in a way that benefits me in the long run.</p>
       <p>Another realization that has deeply impacted me is the understanding that personal growth is not a one-time event—it is a continuous process. Every day, we encounter new experiences that shape us in different ways. We are constantly learning, adapting, and evolving. Some changes happen gradually, while others hit us suddenly. But the important thing is to embrace growth and keep moving forward.</p>
       <p>Looking back, I see a version of myself that was afraid, hesitant, and unsure of many things. But the person I am today is more confident, self-aware, and capable. And even though I will continue to evolve, I am proud of the progress I have made so far. Growth is not always easy, but it is necessary. I am excited to see where life takes me next and how much more I will learn in the coming years.</p>
       <p>So, to anyone who feels like they are changing and evolving—embrace it. It is a sign of growth, and growth is a beautiful thing.</p>
