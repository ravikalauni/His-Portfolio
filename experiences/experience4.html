        <h4>
            Liking people is a bit of a complex concept, but in my circle, there are many different types of people. Especially those who make me feel comfortable enough to talk. I believe the people I like are not chosen based on their looks, but rather their emotions and how they treat me. It all comes down to their intentions. If their initial intentions are good, I dive into their emotions to understand them better. If I sense something is off or that I don't deserve their behavior, I move on.
</h4><h4><br>
That doesn’t mean I completely ignore them or become a stranger. It's just that, for a while, I ask myself if this person is good for me. If they talk to me and seem to want to connect, then I’ll be open to that. But if they make me feel like my existence doesn’t matter to them, then naturally, I stop caring about their existence as well.
        </h4>
