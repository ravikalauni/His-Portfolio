        <h2>Learning to Take Inspiration, Not Just Copying Others</h2><br><hr>
        <p class="date">14 November 2024 - Experience</p>

       
        <p>Inspiration is a powerful thing, but growing up, I kind of misunderstood it. I come from a place where people often mix up inspiration with straight-up copying. Since I was a kid, I kept hearing things like, “Why don’t you be like him?” or “Look at your friend, he’s doing great! Learn from him.” But here’s the thing—he’s him, and I’m me. If he’s good at something, does that mean I have to do the exact same thing?</p>
        
        <p>My parents always compared me with others. If someone my age was cooking, they’d be like, “See, he can cook at your age, but you can’t!” But what if I flipped it? What if I said, “There are people your age who are NASA scientists or airline pilots—why aren’t you?” That wouldn’t sound very polite, right?</p>
        
        <br><h4>My Mindset Shift</h4> <hr>
        
        <p>As I grew up, my way of thinking changed. I started realizing what real inspiration is. The question hit me hard: Why should I be someone else? If I become them, then who will be me? That’s when I understood life isn’t about blindly following someone else’s path—it’s about carving my own while learning from others.</p>
        
        <p>Just cuz my friend is preparing for the Civil Service exam doesn’t mean I gotta do it too. That’s not my thing. I’m doing what I love, and that’s what matters. Maybe I’m not a so-called "big success" yet, but at least I’m trying my best. Those who succeed don’t just wake up one day and make it big—there’s a whole lot of effort behind the scenes.</p>
        
        <br><h4>Environment and Mindset Matter</h4><hr>
        
        <p>I feel like if someone never lets go of their childhood dreams, they can actually make them come true. As kids, we say stuff like, “I wanna be a doctor or an engineer.” But as we grow up, society and money problems start messing with our minds. We start thinking, “Maybe this isn’t for me.” But what if we didn’t let those doubts win? What if we kept pushing?</p>
        
        <p>A lot of successful people came from tough backgrounds, but we only see their success, not the crazy amount of hard work they put in. That’s the real problem.</p>
        
        <br><h4>Adapting, Not Copying</h4><hr>
        
        <p>For me, inspiration isn’t about copying someone’s exact journey. It’s about learning their strategies and using them in my own way. If someone became successful by talking to people, I don’t need to copy their exact style—I can find my own way to connect with others.</p>
        
        <p>If Elon Musk became a billionaire by making rockets, that doesn’t mean I have to make rockets too. He read thousands of books to master engineering, so I need to learn a ton about whatever I wanna be good at. If Mark Zuckerberg made Facebook, does that mean I gotta make another Facebook? Of course not! I gotta do something different.</p>
        
        <br><h4>Who Inspires Me?</h4><hr>
        
        <p>I take inspiration from a lot of people—some super famous, some just regular but inspiring in their own way. A few names that stand out to me:</p>
        
        <p><li>Elon Musk – crazy visionary, always pushing limits.<br></li>
            <li>Mark Zuckerberg – changed how we connect with people.<br></li>
                <li>Markus "Notch" Persson – made Minecraft, a game that took over the world.<br></li>
                    <li>Ratan Tata – business legend, yet super humble.<br></li>
                        <li>Abraham Lincoln – never gave up, even in the worst times.<br></li>
                            <li>Albert Einstein – changed how we see the world.<br></li>
                                <li>Leonardo da Vinci – dude was a genius in like, everything.<br></li>
                                    <li>Sundar Pichai – proved that talent and hard work can take you anywhere.</li></p>
        
        <p>I don’t just admire these people; I actually study them. I watch interviews, read about their struggles, and learn how they think. I even get inspiration from fictional characters like Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, and Iron Man. They might not be real, but their stories teach resilience, intelligence, and never giving up.</p>
        
        <br><h4>Always Learning and Exploring</h4><hr>
        
        <p>Apart from people, I get inspired by books and just exploring the internet. Reading opens up new ideas, and the internet is full of knowledge if you know where to look. I watch podcasts, listen to different perspectives, and stay curious about the world. The more I learn, the more I grow.</p>
        
        <br><h4>And Yes!</h4><hr>
        
        <p>If you wanna take inspiration from someone, don’t just copy them. Take their mindset, their work ethic, their way of thinking, and use it in your own life. Everyone has their own journey. Success isn’t about being a copy of someone else—it’s about becoming the best version of yourself. So yeah, find inspiration, but always be YOU.</p>
