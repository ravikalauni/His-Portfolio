               Growing up in a remote area, I never imagined that I would one day be discussing something as significant as Artificial Intelligence (AI). Back then, life was simple. The magic of a printing machine or a speaker playing music would leave me amazed, wondering how something that wasn’t alive could do such wonderful things. I would see machines, whether in a shop or a neighbour’s house, and wonder how they worked. At that time, machines seemed like magic, something I couldn’t quite understand.

            <p>
               Now, I’m studying at Brixton College, as one of the first students in the BCA programme. I look back at my journey, from a village child to a student studying technology, and I see how far I’ve come. What was once magic has now become something I’m learning to understand. The journey from wondering about machines to working with them has made me realise one thing: no matter how advanced technology becomes, it’s something we can learn, use, and even improve.
            </p>

               We live in an era of rapid technological growth. Machines are now a part of our everyday lives, whether it’s in the form of AI, robots, or self-driving cars. The question of “Man vs. Machine” is no longer just a topic in science fiction films. It’s a real question that impacts all of us— how we work, how we live, and how we relate to machines.

           Today, we have robots and machines that can do things that were once only possible for humans. Robots like Sophia, who can talk and interact like a human, and Pepper, the robot that works in shopping centres, show how machines are becoming more human-like. Pepper can recognise people’s emotions and even greet customers, making it ideal for customer service jobs. Then there’s Atlas, a robot created by Boston Dynamics. Atlas can run, jump, and even perform backflips. Think about how this kind of robot could help in rescue missions in remote places like the mountains of my village. It could save lives by reaching areas that are difficult for humans to access.
            <p>
            Ameca is another example of a humanoid robot, known for its realistic facial expressions. It’s designed to have conversations with humans, making it look like you’re talking to another person. Nao, a small robot, is being used in schools and universities across the world to help teach children programming and even assist students with special learning needs. It’s
 
inspiring to see how these robots are not only making life easier but are also opening up new possibilities for education.

                <p>
One more example is Spot, a four-legged robot that can carry heavy loads. Imagine a robot like Spot helping farmers in the Terai by checking crops in large fields or carrying heavy equipment. These are just a few examples, but they show how robots and machines are becoming more advanced and capable every day.

            </p>
             <b class="sub-heading"><i>Positive Impacts</i></b><br><br>

             <li><b>Increased Efficiency:</b> AI has the ability to process vast amounts of data in seconds, making work easier and faster. For instance, in healthcare, AI can help doctors diagnose diseases quicker and more accurately. It can even predict potential health risks by analyzing medical data.</li>
             <li><b>Job Creation:</b> While AI may take over some jobs, it also creates new ones. There is an increasing demand for data scientists, AI specialists, and robot developers. These are jobs that didn’t exist a decade ago but are now essential in the tech industry.</li>
             <li><b>Better Decision-Making:</b> AI algorithms can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights that help people make better decisions. In agriculture, AI can predict the best times for planting and harvesting crops, helping farmers increase their yields and minimize waste.</li>
             <li><b>Improved Quality of Life:</b> AI-powered personal assistants like Siri and Alexa are now helping people with daily tasks. AI is also being used to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. For example, AI-powered tools are helping the visually impaired navigate the world and communicate more effectively.</li>


             <hr>
             <b class="sub-heading"><i>Negative Impacts</i></b><br><br>
             <img src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/robots-replace-humans.jpg" alt="Multiple earths" class="article-image">


            <li><b>Job Loss:</b> As AI takes over tasks that were once done by humans, certain jobs are at risk. For example, in factories, robots are replacing manual labor, and in offices, AI systems are taking over repetitive tasks like data entry. This can lead to unemployment if workers are not trained for new roles in the AI industry.</li>
            <li><b>Privacy Issues:</b> AI is used in surveillance systems, and while it can improve safety, it can also infringe on people’s privacy. AI-powered cameras can track people’s movements, and AI algorithms can analyze personal data without consent, leading to concerns about privacy violations.</li>
            <li><b>Dependence on Machines:</b> As AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, there’s a growing risk that we could become too dependent on machines. If machines fail or are hacked, it could cause major disruptions in society, from traffic jams caused by self-driving cars to the collapse of healthcare systems that rely on AI for diagnosis.</li>

            <b class="sub-heading">AI in Popular Culture: The Good and the Bad</b><hr>

<p>The question of "Man vs. Machine" has been explored in films for decades, often portraying both the positive and negative aspects of AI.</p>

<p>In the 2010 South Indian film Robot (also known as Enthiran in Tamil), we see a robot, Chitti, created by a scientist, Dr. Vaseegaran, to serve humanity. Initially, Chitti is designed to help with everyday tasks and work with the army. However, when Chitti becomes more intelligent and develops human emotions, he starts questioning the world around him. In the film, the robot’s growing power and emotional intelligence lead to chaos, as Chitti turns against his creator, showing the dangers of AI when it goes beyond control.</p>

<p>The film explores the fear of AI becoming too powerful and acting on its own desires, making us question the responsibility that comes with creating intelligent machines.</p>

<p>In Hollywood, we have seen similar themes in films like The Matrix and Terminator. In The Matrix, a super-intelligent AI, known as The Matrix, creates a simulated reality to keep humans under control while using their bodies as an energy source. The film portrays a dystopian future where AI has gained power over humanity, turning it into a fight for survival.</p>
            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/c/ce/The_Machines.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120510160637" alt="Multiple earths" class="article-image">
<p>In Terminator, a self-aware AI system called Skynet decides that humanity is a threat and begins a war to destroy it. The idea of AI turning against its creators is a common theme in these films, warning us about the potential dangers of machines becoming too powerful.</p>

<p>These films portray the dual nature of AI—while it has the potential to improve our lives, it also comes with risks that we must address.</p>

<b class="sub-heading">AI in Nepal: A Growing Opportunity</b><hr>
            <img src="https://publisher-publish.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/pb-nepalitimes/swp/asv65r/media/20231230021248_354194b90332a9d05ecca9ad294eb4b0030705f3f7c65b105e6e49bceffe9e4c.jpg" alt="Multiple earths" class="article-image">

<p>When we think of AI, we often think about countries like the United States, Japan, or China. But Nepal is slowly catching up. Though we don’t yet have robots walking around in our streets, AI is already making an impact in many areas of Nepal.</p>

<p>In the field of agriculture, AI is helping farmers make better decisions. For example, AI tools can predict the weather, detect pests in crops, and suggest the best time to plant and harvest. This is already being used in parts of Nepal like the Terai, where farming is a key part of the economy. AI can help farmers increase their crop yield and make farming more efficient.</p>

<p>In healthcare, AI is helping doctors and hospitals provide better care. In cities like Kathmandu, AI is being used to diagnose diseases faster, and it helps doctors manage patient records. In remote areas like Baitadi, Dadeldhura, AI-powered telemedicine could help doctors reach patients in places where healthcare services are limited. Imagine being able to get a diagnosis or a prescription with just a few clicks on your phone. It’s the future of healthcare, and it’s coming to Nepal.</p>

<p>AI is also starting to change the education system in Nepal. At Brixton College, where I am studying, we use AI-powered platforms to enhance learning. These platforms can identify areas where students need help and provide personalised lessons. In rural schools, AI can be used to help students who might not have access to the same resources as those in cities.</p>

<p>AI is even transforming the e-commerce sector. Online shopping websites like Daraz are using AI to suggest products to customers based on their search history. This makes shopping easier and more personalised. As more people in Nepal use smartphones and the internet, AI will become even more important in everyday life.</p>

<b class="sub-heading">Man and Machine:</b><hr>
<p>The question of “Man vs. Machine” is not about choosing one over the other. It’s about how we can work together with machines to make our world a better place. While machines can never replace the creativity, empathy, and intuition that make us human, they can help us do things faster and more efficiently. With AI, we have the power to solve problems that once seemed impossible.</p>

<p>For me, now studying technology at Brixton College, I’ve realised that technology is not something to fear. It’s something we can use to make our lives better and help us achieve things that were once only dreams. The future is not about choosing between man and machine—it’s about finding a way for both to coexist and thrive together.</p>

<b class="sub-heading">Conclusion: A Future of Collaboration</b><hr>
            <img src="https://images.stockcake.com/public/5/c/5/5c5fbff0-d45e-47a7-b2bf-28e15387c48e_large/human-meets-robot-stockcake.jpg" alt="Multiple earths" class="article-image">

<p>As we step into an era where Artificial Intelligence continues to evolve at an unprecedented rate, it is clear that we stand at the crossroads of a major technological revolution. From robots helping with rescue missions to AI systems transforming agriculture, healthcare, and education, the potential benefits are immense. However, as we have seen through the examples from films like Robot, The Matrix, and Terminator, there are also significant risks that must be carefully managed.</p>

<p>The debate of "Man vs. Machine" is no longer just a philosophical question but a real-world challenge that requires thoughtful consideration. While AI has the power to improve our lives in countless ways, it is our responsibility to ensure that its development is ethical, transparent, and guided by the values that make us human. The future of AI will not be about one side winning over the other; rather, it will be about how we use this powerful tool to work alongside machines to solve some of the world’s most pressing issues.</p>

<p>In Nepal, as in the rest of the world, the possibilities are endless. From empowering farmers in rural areas with AI-driven solutions to improving healthcare access in remote regions, the integration of AI can change lives for the better. However, we must remain vigilant, ensuring that we guide AI development in a direction that serves humanity as a whole.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the question is not whether man or machine will prevail, but how both can coexist and collaborate to create a future where technology enhances the human experience, rather than replacing it. The choice is ours—let’s make it one that embraces progress while preserving the essence of what it means to be human.</p>
